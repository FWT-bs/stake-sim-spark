        <h1>Terms of Service for EzGame</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 8, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to EzGame ("we," "our," or "us"). By accessing or using our website, products, services, or applications (collectively, the "Platform"), you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use our Platform.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher) to use our Platform. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Platform complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you. We reserve the right to request age verification documents at any time.</p>

        <h2>3. Geographic Restrictions</h2>
        <p>We do not allow access to our services from jurisdictions where online gaming is prohibited by law. We reserve the right to restrict or block access based on your IP address, GPS, or geolocation data. Use of VPNs or similar tools to bypass regional restrictions is prohibited and may result in account suspension.</p>

        <h2>4. Currency System</h2>
        <p>Our Platform operates using two types of virtual currencies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FunCoin (FC):</strong> A fictional, non-redeemable digital currency used for entertainment purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>RealCoin (RC):</strong> A virtual token that may be acquired by eligible users either through direct purchase, promotional giveaways, or as a complimentary gift with FC purchases (in applicable jurisdictions).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Purchasing FC does not grant you any rights to RC in jurisdictions where such promotions are prohibited. RC has no value outside the Platform unless explicitly stated.</p>

        <h2>5. Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
        <p>Users in eligible jurisdictions may purchase RC using accepted payment methods. RC may be redeemable for certain rewards, including gift cards or cryptocurrencies, subject to verification and availability. We may limit the amount you can deposit or withdraw in a given period.</p>
        <p>In jurisdictions with limitations, users may only purchase FC. Any RC awarded alongside FC is considered a promotional bonus and has no monetary value until withdrawal is approved.</p>
        <p>Withdrawal requests may require identity verification, including government-issued ID, proof of address, and age confirmation. We reserve the right to delay or deny withdrawals if fraudulent or suspicious activity is detected.</p>

        <h2>6. No Real Gambling</h2>
        <p>The games provided on our Platform are intended for entertainment only and do not constitute gambling in jurisdictions where gambling is restricted. Winnings from games are denominated in FC or RC and do not represent real-world value unless expressly stated.</p>

        <h2>7. Provably Fair System</h2>
        <p>We use provably fair algorithms to ensure game outcomes are random and verifiable. Users may inspect seed hashes and result calculations to confirm fairness. Game logs and historical data may be made available for audit by the player.</p>

        <h2>8. Account Security</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and any activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use. Sharing your account is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <h2>9. Responsible Gaming</h2>
        <p>We support responsible gaming. Users may self-exclude, set deposit limits, or request temporary suspensions at any time. If you believe you have a gambling problem, please seek help from appropriate resources. Links to third-party support organizations may be provided.</p>

        <h2>10. Suspicious Activity and Fraud</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts involved in fraudulent, abusive, or suspicious behavior, including manipulation of games, account sharing, money laundering, or abuse of promotions. We cooperate with legal authorities where required.</p>

        <h2>11. Advertising and Offers</h2>
        <p>You may see advertisements while using our Platform. By using the Platform, you agree to receive promotional materials unless you opt out. Ads may be displayed via popups or embedded formats. Some features may be unlocked or rewarded through ad viewing.</p>

        <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content, logos, graphics, code, and trademarks on the Platform are our property or licensed to us. You may not use, reproduce, or distribute any content without our express written permission.</p>

        <h2>13. Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the Platform constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>14. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for violations of these Terms or for other reasons, with or without notice. Upon termination, your access to virtual currencies and account data may be revoked.</p>

        <h2>15. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Platform is provided "as is" and "as available." We make no warranties regarding uptime, accuracy, or availability. We do not guarantee that the Platform will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>

        <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Platform, including but not limited to loss of data, earnings, or opportunity. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the past 12 months.</p>

        <h2>17. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We may integrate third-party services or content (such as game providers, ad networks, or payment processors). We are not responsible for third-party actions, terms, or content.</p>

        <h2>18. Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your data and account information may be transferred to a new entity, subject to these same Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>19. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction in which EzGame is registered. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.</p>

        <h2>20. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For questions about these Terms, contact us at: support@ezgame.example.</p>
